# PIH EMR HTML Forms Documentation

This document describes all XML forms in `openmrs-config-pihemr/configuration/pih/htmlforms/`, organized by clinical area.  These forms are shared by multiple implementations (ZL, Liberia, Mexico, and Sierra Leone) and the default forms.  Not all of these forms are used by each implementation.  Many of them are replaced by the country configurations (ie. NCD, vitals, etc).  The majority of these forms are used by ZL (Haiti).

## Architecture Notes

### Form Patterns
- **Wrapper forms** (e.g., ncd-initial.xml, ancFollowup.xml) are thin shells that reference `encounter-with-sections.xml` for modular section composition.
- **Section forms** (section-*.xml) are reusable building blocks included via subform tags; they are not typically standalone encounters.
- **Full forms** (e.g., surgicalPostOpNote.xml, deathCertificate.xml) embed all content directly.

### Versioning
Many forms have versioned siblings (v1.0, v2.0, _v1.1, etc.). The unversioned filename is typically the current production version; versioned files represent prior versions retained for backward compatibility or active parallel use (e.g., REDCap study variants).

### Common Technical Features
- **Post-submission actions:** `ApplyDispositionAction`, `CleanDiagnosisConstructAction`, `CleanPrescriptionConstructAction`, `ExitPatientFromCovidProgramAction`
- **Subform inclusion** for encounter metadata (provider/location/date) and drug orders
- **Velocity/Freemarker** conditionals for role-, gender-, age-, and encounter-type-based field visibility
- **JavaScript** for unit conversions, calculated fields (gestational age, BMI, waist-hip ratio), cross-form data fetching, and form validation
- **Bilingual support** — most forms have French and English label translations
- **Print view** — distinct CSS styling for print layout; surgical/delivery forms include timestamps
